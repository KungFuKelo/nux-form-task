            <p class="font-semibold">Dear Eng Ayman Alshiekh,</p>
            <p>I wanted to let you know that I have completed the test you assigned me, and everything is working as
                expected.
                However, I did make some pragmatic decisions due to the tight time window. I would like to mention that I
                have
                some ideas to make the code cleaner and more readable in case you are interested.</p>
            <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for considering me for this position. It was a
                challenging and exciting experience, and I learned a lot from it. I'm confident that I can apply this
                knowledge
                to future projects and be a valuable member of your team.</p>
            <p>In case you have any feedback on my work or the hiring process itself, I would be more than happy to hear it.
                Please let me know if there is anything I can improve on, or if you have any specific requests or questions
                for
                me.</p>
            <p>Thank you again for the opportunity to showcase my skills. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
            <p class="font-semibold">Mohamed Alkayal</p>
